# Creating a menu with a radial menu

To begin using the radial menu system, you first need to create a new UMG widget (or use an existing one).

Next, in the UMG editor, search for `Radial Menu UMG` and drag it into your widget.
The widget can be sized as needed.

Next, connect the `Update Input` function in you tick event of the custom widget.
This is all that is needed for the radial menu to work.

Now, you'll want to add actual icons for use in the next section.
