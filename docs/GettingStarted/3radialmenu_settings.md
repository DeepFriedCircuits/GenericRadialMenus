###Segments

The default number of segments in the radial menu.

###Material Base

What material to use in the radial menu. Check `PieMenus/Materials` for different options.

###Allow Resizing

By setting this to true, the radial menu will add more sections as you add items. This can get a little cramped
if you add too many items.

###Joystick to Use

Which joystick for the menu to listen to.

###Mouse Deadzone

Determines the distance the mouse needs to travel from the center of the screen before registering as input.
This variable doesn't need much changing, but is there for tweaking if necessary.

###Joystick Deadzone

Same as the mouse deadzone, except for the joystick.

###Selection Changed Sound

The sound made when a new section is selected on the menu.
If no sound is desired, set to nothing.
