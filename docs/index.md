# Welcome to the Generic Radial Menus Documentation!

To get up and running quickly, start with [Setting Up Input](./GettingStarted/Setting_up_Input.md),
which will get joystick input working in the radial menus. After that, we'll go
over creating your own widgets that utilize the radial menus, and how to your icons
to them. You can also find a detailed description of every [exposed parameter on
the radial menus here](./GettingStarted/RadialMenuSettings.md).

**Please note: this documentation is still under construction, so if you run into
UNDER CONSTRUCTION anywhere on the site, that page is not finished yet.**

If you can't find the answers to your questions here, feel free to join the [**PolyHavoc**
discord channel](https://discord.gg/uqXdbEK) and ask in the **support** channel.
